THE ISSUER. The beginning of the chain in the complex web of the stock market. In 2023 approximately $35.5 Trillion of retirement accounts was held in the stock market. This money is held by private pensions, IRAs, 401Ks, and individual investment accounts. Unpacking what the market, an industry that is believed to have integrity and security, yet has always seemed opaque, we must begin with vocabulary that is not often used on main street. The Issuer is the Company that wants to 'go public'. When an individual or group create a company, they start with legal documents designating the business structure desired, file with government agencies, and then offer their goods or services to the public. After achievening an annual monetary benchmark another process to "Go Public" begins in the IPO( Initial Public Offering).

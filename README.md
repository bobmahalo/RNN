We would like to make this a place for down the middle information, backed by sources, for understanding the market plumbing. Anyone who feels like they have a subject they would like to expand on can leave it here with sources. From time to time the essays may be picked up by other groups and shared. Please don't be shy, be critical, as that is how we root out the inaccuracy. Mahalo

TRASNFER AGENT In order to take a private company public there are certain legal steps that must be followed. One of the first things is to get a Transfer Agent. This is the entity that acts as a sponsor for the Issuer. The organization that interfaces between the stock exchanges and the Issuer can't possibly screen every company that wants to go public, so the Transfer Agent  does its due diligence and 'sponsors' the issuer as a fisrt step in the process. Another critical role of the  Transfer Agent is to  record changes of ownership, maintain the issuer's security holder records, cancel and issue certificates, and distribute dividends. Because transfer agents stand between issuing companies and security holders, efficient transfer agent operations are critical to the successful completion of secondary trades.
